# Code-Vault
Program to Store Code Snippets in a SQLite DB or On Your Computer C Drive

When you first run Code Vault you will create the Database(DB) and Tables by clicking
the CreateDB button and following the prompts.

Once Code Vault is installed and the DB and Tables are created the opening page has an 
About button that explains some necessary setup procedures. 

Code Vault has two ways to store your favorite code snippets.
1. Is in a SQLite database that will sort your code snippets by code type language.
    These snippets will have a meaningful name created by you when saving to the DB. 
2. Is on your C hard drive in a folder created named C:\A A Code Vault\Data as text files.
If you do not like this idea DO NOT USE View or Create Code Files on C Drive function.

Code Vault makes use of the clipboard to streamline the process of saving snippets
to the DB or as Files.
The project was written with VB.Net and is a Windows Forms Application.

If you want to see the code download the Zip file
To install Code Vault download the CodeVault.exe file

Code Vault is a little like a Swiss Army Knife or It is redundant because you can save
Code Snippets as Files on your Hard Drive and in the SQLite Database named CodeVault.db
To view the DB you can use the free program DB Browser.
